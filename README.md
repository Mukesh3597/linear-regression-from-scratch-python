# Linear Regression from Scratch in Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the complete implementation of **Linear Regression from scratch using Python**, without relying on built-in machine learning models. The goal is to understand the internal working of linear regression, gradient descent, and loss functions.

## 🚀 Features
- Manual dataset creation
- Data visualization
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function
- Gradient Descent optimization
- Model training from scratch
- Performance evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)
- Visualization of regression line and loss curve
- Comparison with Scikit-Learn Linear Regression

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.10+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## 📈 Output Visualizations
- Dataset scatter plot
- Regression line (custom vs sklearn)
- Loss curve comparison
